<h1>Python Basics</h1>
<p>This is a simple Python project where the user would input information based on the questions asked. It asks the user to enter a price of an item. It will then prompt the user if they would like to continue or if they would like to quit. If the user would like to continue, they can keep adding in different prices of items until they wish to quit. Once the user prompts to quit, the cash register will take the total sum of all the items entered and display the quantity entered as well as the sum. 
  <ul><b>CashRegister.py</b> - This contains the python code </ul>
