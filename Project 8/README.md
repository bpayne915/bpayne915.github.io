<h1>Project 1</h1>
<h2>Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Detection</h2>
<b>DSC 680 - Bellevue University</b>

<p>The purpose of this project was to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning algorithm. The dataset contains only images. The images are of normal/healthy breast tissue and breast tissue that contains Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). IDC makes up 80% of all breast cancer types. Image detection and classification can be very useful and a powerful tool for people's health. This project contains the following:
<ul><b>Training Folder</b> - This folder contains images used for training the model</ul>
<ul><b>Testing Folder</b> - This folder contains images used for testing the model</ul>
<ul><b>Validation Folder</b> - This folder contains images used for validating the model</ul>
